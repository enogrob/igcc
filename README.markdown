InteractiveC
============

InteractiveC is a really sloppy 'c interpreter' I threw together to help me catch up on my C.

It currently doesn't nicely handle blocks if entered line-by-line (and probably a lot of other things).  If you want to test blocks, write them in a text editor and paste it into IC.

This requires a rewrite if it's going to actually be a nice clean program.  As it stands it's a useful hack.
